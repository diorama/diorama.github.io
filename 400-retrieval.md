3D Object Retrieval allows the search for a set of similar 3D models, having a single model as an example.
This utility is particularly powerful and useful when dealing with a large set of models (as in the Diorama
Marketplace).
Additionally, in a 3D modelling context, 3D Object Retrieval allows users to specify shapes roughly, having the ability
to replace these 3D sketches with pre-existing models later.
