Diorama offers a Digital Asset Management (DAM) service for 3D content, with powerful search options, 
allowing users to filter results based on date, popularity, similarity and types of 3D models.

![][collections]

Featuring a powerful and lightweight Web-based 3D model viewer supported by the most common desktop and mobile browsers,
users are able to interact easily with 3D models in all platforms without the need of third-party software.

![][model-viewer]

Supporting most common 3D file formats, users can upload models and associate metadata such as description, tags,
comments and add makes (images and description of printed 3D model). 
Models can be downloaded, printed (locally or using an online 3D printing service), shared in social networks, and also
forked by other users (that can later customize them). 

![][model-details]

Versioning is also supported, allowing users to upload multiple model versions, 
select and compare them in a 3D environment. Versions of the same model can be compared using overlays with opacity 
control or split mode with coordinated manipulation.
